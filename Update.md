## Deployment (notes)

The site is static and can be deployed to any static host. Quick options:

- GitHub Pages (quick):

    1. Push your repo to GitHub.
    2. In repository Settings → Pages, select branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root `/`.
    3. Save — site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>`.

- Netlify (drag & drop or from Git):

    1. Create a Netlify account and connect your GitHub repo (or drag the built folder).
    2. Set publish directory to `/` (this is a static site).
    3. Deploy — Netlify provides a URL and optional custom domain.

- Vercel (from Git):

    1. Import the repo into Vercel, set framework to "Other" and root to `/`.
    2. Deploy — Vercel will provide a preview and production URL.

Notes:
- No build step is required; files are static. If you change paths or use a subfolder, adjust the publish settings.
- I left deployment to you as requested — you can deploy with any of the above tomorrow.
